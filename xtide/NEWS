XTide 2.15.6 (libxtide.so.1.0.6) (2025-06-16)

   XTide 2.15.6 fixed a bug that caused garbled text in graphs and
   improved the behavior of text selection and editing in control panel
   text fields when XTide is linked with Xaw3dXft.  Get it from
   [3]https://flaterco.com/xtide/files.html and see the [4]changelog for
   details.

Data refresh 2024-12-29

   The data refresh available from
   [5]https://flaterco.com/xtide/files.html#harmonicsfiles includes
   routine updates and corrections.  A corresponding update of the
   harmonic constants management package is available from
   [6]https://flaterco.com/xtide/files.html#experts.

tcd-utils 2024-02-22

   This legacy package for converting Tide Constituent Database (TCD)
   files to and from other formats has been refreshed to fix a FTB with
   GCC 14.  Get the latest from
   [7]https://flaterco.com/xtide/files.html#extras.

Mailing list migration 2024-02-04

   There is an announce-only mailing list to which I send notices of each
   update to XTide or the harmonics data.  Effective 2024-02-04, it has
   moved to Google Groups.  If you want to remain on the list, please
   subscribe to the new one.

   To subscribe any address, send an email to
   [8]xtide-announce+subscribe@googlegroups.com and reply to the
   confirmation email.  Those with Google accounts can instead sign in and
   join directly at [9]https://groups.google.com/d/forum/xtide-announce.
   The archives can be viewed by anyone at
   [10]https://groups.google.com/d/forum/xtide-announce.

   The archives of the old mailing list will remain at
   [11]https://pairlist10.pair.net/pipermail/xtide-announce/ until they
   are deleted.

ftp is dead

   The archive is at [12]https://flaterco.com/files/xtide/.  Old links
   pointing to ftp://ftp.flaterco.com/xtide/... should be redirected to
   https://flaterco.com/files/xtide/....

End of maintenance for non-free data

   For [13]various reasons, I have ended maintenance of the non-free data
   set.  Anyone interested in generating new harmonic constants from
   published data can find information and a list of data sources
   [14]here.

To do list

   Fix Dstr.

   XTide

   Aging has placed XTide in the undesirable category of legacy X apps
   that require ugly scaling by the desktop to prevent things from
   becoming tiny on a 4k display.  A significant renovation of the GUI is
   needed:
     * Migrate from Xaw/Xaw3d/Xaw3dXft to (maybe) FLTK, acquiring native
       Wayland support as a bonus.
     * Make all displayed windows scalable.

   Non-GUI items:
     * Modernize LaTeX format output (XeLaTeX, better font, maybe auto
       page sizing).
     * Support [15]QGIS integration as a substitute for the builtin
       location chooser.
     * Support m/s as a unit for currents.  NOAA default is now cm/s.
     * Implement [16]RFC 4180 CSV format with quoting instead of the
       stupid vertical bar substitution for commas.
     * If libxtide is changed, consider merging some accommodations from
       XTideMac.
          + Opting out of LibPNG, RGBGraph, Settings, and codeset support.
          + Compiler was opinionated about character encoding and int
            types.
          + Configure for dirent.h, syslog.h.
     * Purge antique portability workarounds.
     * Make xttpd use https.
     * Support lookup by station ID instead of only name.
     * The XML parser should be bundled under the libxtide namespace but
       isn't.

   Major things to do in XTide 3 if life turns out not to be too short
   after all:
     * Migrate to a better language or at least a newer version of C++.
     * Refactor libxtide to remove unnecessary complexity.  Remove
       hydraulic current support.  Standardize units used internally.
     * Support minor axes for currents; yield speed and direction at any
       time; plot as a cylinder.
     * Find a way to put an end to the infinite number of customization
       settings for graph mode, such as by dumping ALL of the data,
       metadata, and events to a single-file format that an external
       graphing app will read.
     * Renovate programming practices again (exceptions, checked and const
       operations, strings).
     * On exceptions:  get the application-specific error messages OUT of
       libxtide.
     * Move from Latin-1 to UTF-8 (requires libtcd revision).
     * Harmonize the globe location chooser with the way that Google Earth
       operates.  Migrate to OpenGL, Vulkan, whatever.

   tideEditor
     * Fix Qt deprecation warnings.
     * Make it usable on low-resolution displays.
     * Synchronize location chooser scaling with XTide.

   harmbase2

   All the cheap and nasty reverse geocoding for the purpose of improving
   station descriptions is stupid and should be punted to [17]QGIS.

   harmgen

   It should be possible to [18]link directly with liboctave to avoid the
   very inefficient conversion of input data from binary to text and back
   again that currently is done.  However, this would be fixing something
   that is not broken, and is neither important nor urgent.

   libtcd

   Purge antique portability workarounds from configure.ac.  Always just
   include stdint not inttypes.

   In signed_bit_unpack, extend_mask << numbits uses undefined behavior.

   In the documentation section on inference, cite NOAA SP NOS CO-OPS 3
   Sec. 4.2.3 explaining how bogus it is.

   Things to do in the next major revision, if there ever is one:
     * Purge COMPAT114 code and documentation.
     * UTF-8.
     * Move station ID to header.
     * Add header field to flag tides versus currents.
     * Add depth field for currents.
     * Support minor axes for currents.
     * Get rid of internal state; fix inability to have more than one
       database open.
     * Remove gratuitous complexity in the encoding of speeds, equilibrium
       arguments, and node factors; make speeds 32-bit unsigned with no
       offset.
     * Possibly permit node factors to be specified for intervals shorter
       than 1 year and/or support apps that use libcongen to generate the
       node factors themselves.
